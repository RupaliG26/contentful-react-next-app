# Solution for the front-end code challenge for [Marley Spoon](https://gist.github.com/GHMT/8cca1f47b9c90af19c1622f0463a44ab)

This code uses nextjs, typescript and reactjs for the development purpose.

## Out of scope (as it was not mentioned in the guidelines)

* I have not included any unit tests for the code currently. If required, I can do that later.

## Run the code by following the below guidelines:

**NOTE:** I am using NodeJS version 12.18.2 for the development purpose.

### `npm install` 
For installing the dependencies

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000/recipe-list](http://localhost:3000/recipe-list) to view it on the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
The errors can be seen on the console.

### `npm run build`

It bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
